##Practices 
  ##Practice 1: Dynamic Programming 
  DP is a paradigm that solves problems by combining subproblems once then saving the result.
  This subproblems overlapping and the principal characteristics are:
   - Using to optimizing problems.
   - They can have many solutions. 
   - Each solution we can found, one solution with a local optimal value (maximum, minimum).
   - We can reconstruct which values are part of the solution.
   
   Problems to solve:
   - [-] Snapsack problem.
   - [-] Coin Change.
   - [-] Stairs.
   
   ##Practice 2: Dynamic Programming 2
   
   Problems to solve:
   - [-] Matrix Chain Multiplication.

   ##Practice 3: Genetic Algorithm 
   It refers to a series of steps to solve a problem then when combining it with genetics, simulate
   the evolution of species to formulate the steps to follow with the same objective to solve problems.
   
   Problems to solve:
   - [-] Genetic Algorithm (GAS) to minimize Ackley's function in 2D.
   - [-] GAS to minimize Rastrigin's function in 3D.
